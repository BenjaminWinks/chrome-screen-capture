   # Checkout /trunk into a working copy
      * `svn checkout https://chrome-screen-capture.googlecode.com/svn/trunk chrome-screen-capture`
   # Make code change
   # Update working copy to the head revision and resolve conflicts if there is any
      * `cd /path/to/chrome-screen-capture`
      * `svn update`
   # Commit changed files in working copy into /trunk
      * `cd /path/to/chrome-screen-capture`
      * `svn commit`
