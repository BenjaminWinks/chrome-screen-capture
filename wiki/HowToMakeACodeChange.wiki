Every code change should go through careful review before getting into the main branch. Follow these steps to make a code change:

  # Branch the code in /trunk into /branches/your-new-branch.
    * svn cp https://chrome-screen-capture.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://chrome-screen-capture.googlecode.com/svn/branches/your-new-branch
    * TortoiseSVN:
      # Right click on the directory where you check out the /trunk, choose "Branch/tag...".
      # Change "To URL" to https://chrome-screen-capture.googlecode.com/svn/branches/your-new-branch.
      # Choose "HEAD revision in the repository".
      # Press "OK".
  # Make changes in /branches/your-new-branch.
    # Checkout the code in https://chrome-screen-capture.googlecode.com/svn/branches/your-new-branch.
    # Make changes.
    # Commit your change.
  # [http://code.google.com/p/chrome-screen-capture/issues/entry?show=review&former=sourcelist Request code review], and modify your code in /branches/your-new-branch based on your discussion with your code reviewer.
  # After you get a positive score from your code reviewer, merge /branches/your-new-branch back into /trunk
